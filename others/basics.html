            Are you thinking about trying
            <a href="#">rock climbing?</a> Climbing is a fun and challenging
            sport that has a surge of popularity in recent years. Almost anyone
            can climb: you don't need a high level of strength or fitness to get
            started. Gear is available for men, women, and children of all
            shapes and sizes, and most gyms will allow children as yound as
            three to climb. Climbing is not about brute force. Climbing more
            difficult route does take some strength, mostly in your legs and
            hands, but it also takes&nbsp;&nbsp; skill and problem-solving ability.

            Oh, and it is okay if you are afraid of heights. Really. Just keep
            your eyes on the wall.
